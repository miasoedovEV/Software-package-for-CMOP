  This software package is designed for engineering calculations in the oil and gas industry, and in particular in the direction of pipeline transport of oil and petroleum products.
  The main task of this software package is calculating the main oil pipeline and oil product pipeline with the subsequent placement of pumping stations along the length of the pipeline.
  Also, the functionality of the program includes such operations as: recalculation of the pipe walls along the length of the main pipeline, calculation of the oil and oil product pumping modes, construction of a histogram of the pumped product, construction of the pipeline performance characteristics, construction of a head plot. It can be plotted in the application window and in the CAD system.
  The software package supports the output of the results in the "xls" file format. For convenience of calculations, protocols of the used equipment, and in particular main, support pumps, brands of pipes, and also the protocol of the coefficients used at calculations are created. The equipment and coefficients from the protocols can be used in calculations. A user can also add and remove equipment and coefficients.

To run the software package, you need to run "main.py".
